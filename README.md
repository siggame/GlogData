GlogData is ment to be a data gathering project for MegaMinerAI gamelogs. 

It should be able to take in a proper gamelog from any game then create a datastructure that would have different parameters to allow for data mining. 

Currently it can parse a s-expression game log and creates a dictionary that contains the data for each turn in a list format, still requires more parsing. This will have to be dependent on each game however.
